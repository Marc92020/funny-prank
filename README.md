# Funny Prank project
## Creation:
So I was just thinking about how there are random phising sites (this is not one this is just a safe prank) so I thought if I made this, it could be an awesome prank!
## How it will work:
I will create a fake version of a real website using this thing and then send it to someone and prank them good!
## Is this a real phishing prank? If it is, CAN I REPORT THIS TR-
No no, it's not a phishing site. It is a harmless **prank** that is supposed to trick people.
## Can I send this to people?
Yes you can! The best way is to email them or write a text message to them.
## Does any REAL data get sent to the website?
No. I don't even know how to create a data sending code. Even if I do learn, I won't implement it to this system so I don't get it shut down.
## How much progress is in it?
Part 2 has been made. Now I need to finish the scammed page and i'm done!
